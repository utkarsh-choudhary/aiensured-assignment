  As you can see that you have already been redirected to Password Reset Page.
  
  Enter the 6-digit verification code you mention below.
  Your Reset Code : ${user.resetPassCode}
  
  Create a new, strong password that meets the following requirements:
    1. At least 8 characters long
    2. Contains a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters
    3. Includes at least one number
    4. Contains at least one special character (e.g., !@#$%^&*)
